# Touhou-3-The-Phantasmagoria-of-Dimensional-Dreams-NES-Demake
An NES-style adaptation of the PC-98 game.

**NOTE:** If you want to download and play the demake, please click [here](https://drillimation.itch.io/touhou-3-the-phantasmagoria-of-dimensional-dreams) to access its itch.io page.

***Touhou 3: The Phantasmagoria of Dimensional Dreams*** was originally released for the PC-98 by Team Shanghai Alice in 1997. Drillimation Systems, the developer best known for the *Chuhou Joutai* series, ported the game to PC in the style of an NES game using the GameMaker engine in 2021. It is the third game in the highly popular Touhou Project series and is the first versus shooter in the entire franchise.

Reimu Hakurei, the series' mascot, returns, and Marisa Kirisame and Mima both make their debut as playable characters. One morning while Reimu is on a walk, she receives an invitation to some "mysterious ruins". Only one person can enter, and a big brawl against eight others begins, competing for who will win the right to enter the ruins. Who knows? Maybe their greatest dream will be fulfilled.

*The Phantasmagoria of Dimensional Dreams* wasn't known to many players until the NES demake port released. Before that, *Touhou 6: The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil* is the game that formally introduced most players to the *Touhou Project* franchise. As a result of the demake, the game is now playable on modern machines without the need to configure an emulator.

## About this repository
In 2023, Drillimation released the source code for the game. This repository is intended for GameMaker users wanting to develop their own retro style *Touhou Project* fangame or danmaku shooter, or to improve upon its flaws.

This source code is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial license (CC-BY-NC). Because the game itself is based on the second actual *Touhou Project* game, we have chosen to release it under that license.
