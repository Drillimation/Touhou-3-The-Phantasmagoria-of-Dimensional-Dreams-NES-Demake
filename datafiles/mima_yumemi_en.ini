0="Chiyuri, you lost too quickly!"
1="But..."
2="No 'buts'! And no rear ends#either! I couldn't get nearly#enough data!"
3="Geez, if you had won, we could#have just put her under and#taken her home!"
4="What!?"
5="That's right. I've finally found#the beautiful power called magic#in this world. I won't settle#for just observations anymore."
6="I'm going to take you back as a#test specimen, study that power,#and then make it mine!"
7="Don't be rediculous. How do you#plan on beating me, exactly?"
8="My scientific magic is, after#all, merely an imitation of#magic. It can't prevail against#the real thing."
9="It doesn't use magic - it is a#thing born of only positively-#charged photons and light waves."
10="I don't have magic, but I have#the power of science. Because of#that, I am well-versed in hidden#things."
11="Heh, so this time it'll be you?#You look weaker than that other#one."
12="Is that so? I'll fight you, and#if you manage to win, I'll grant#you a wish. If I win, you'll#come to my world. That's okay,#right?"
13="No."
14="You're in no position to argue#about this anyway."
15="I ain't losing in the first#place! Now, shall we start?"
16="Hold on just a moment. I need to#change into my battle wear."
17="What?"
18="Okay, I'm ready."
19="All you did was put on a cape."
20="*slap*"
21="Give it your all! If you die, I#can't take you back with me#after all."
22="Okay?"
23="Okay, here I come!"
24="You'll be the one to 'go.'"
