0="So, Gensokyo had these ancient#ruins during that time? Was this#the basis for the Kozankyo#Imperial Palace?"
1="Don't move."
2="I ain't movin'!"
3="You're the strongest youkai in#the land, are you? Come with me#then."
4="Are you strong as well?"
5="This might look small, but this#is a lethal weapon. If you value#your life, you'll do as I say."
6="So, what exactly are these#ruins? This might be covered in#my next history test!"
7="Why do you think so? Judging by#what you've said, you come from#a different time period, do you?"
8="Why, yes I do."
9="Come with me anyway."
10="..."
11="*whack*"
12="Who told you to admit this#little girl in orange?"
13="She just wanted to come here."
14="*whack*"
15="Who dared you to bring in such a#youkai-born?"
16="Hold on, what is this?"
17="Please forgive my odd reception."
18="Before you go too far, I didn't#get your names."
19="I am the captain of this ship,#Yumemi Okazaki. It's a pleasure#to meet you."
20="And I'm her crew member, Chiyuri#Kitashirakawa. Nice to meet you."
21="Hold on, what exactly is this#'ship'? Is it really a ship?"
22="Well, yeah. It is definitely a#ship, but it's not intended for#the sea, clouds, or space. It's#something called a probability#space hypervessel."
23="Its intent is to search for#anything that doesn't fit into#the grand unified theory.#Furthermore, it seems to find it#all fast."
24="Seeing magic with your own eyes#means something else!"
25="Well, many argue that magic#isn't real. In reality, it is,#through science."
26="But it still means something#else!"
27="Magic is becoming more and more#possible thanks to the rise in#use of computers."
28="It's ma-gic, right?"
29="I might not know how it was done#in the analog days."
30="What do you mean?"
31="Like a roll of tape or#something."
32="Can you give me the pamphlet?"
33="A pamphlet? Here, let me see."
34="'The Ancient Ruins'#Fantasy Ruins#Opens at 10:00 AM today."
35="Those who visit these ruins will#be given a present to grant them#happiness. We eagerly await your#patronization."
36="What's this? How did you get#here if you're from the future?"
37="A VR machine. 300 years, to be#exact."
38="What's your GPA by the book? If#you have high grades, I want to#study your power and magic in-#depth, and then take revenge#against your school!"
39="The captain subscribes to the#theory that magic exists apart#from the Grand Theory and#announce the Non-Unified Magic#World Theory to your school."
40="When that happens, everyone will#laugh out of place."
41="If at any point if your magic is#powerful, you'll get what is#desired, but I'll won't tell you#what it is."
42="Don't give her anything weak,#pal."
43="I'll give her anything#acceptable."
44="Turn me into something I'll#crave. Don't forget I'm a#political princess!"
45="Do your best, Chiyuri. I'll#monitor the match."
46="What do you mean?"
47="You need to fight her, silly!"
48="Oh God, I'm scared."
49="*whack*"
50="Stop complaining and take her#down! You can win if you have my#scientific magic."
51="You might probably lose in a#landslide, but learn from her#skills. In the meantime, I will#gather her data."
52="I might be trapped, huh. Let the#game begin!"
53="Okie-dokie!"
