0="I don't feel happy about#winning against myself. Was it#really a fake, or does winning#make me the real one? Hmph."
1="This is weird; is Marisa really#weak, or maybe is she not#training enough?"
2="Haha! I beat Mima! It's normal#for a shrine maiden to beat an#evil spirit!"
3="Unfortunately, I'm used to#magic. Sorry!"
4="In ways more than one, that was#scary!"
5="I wonder where she's from, eh?"
6="What's with her clothes; is she#really a heretic? In Gensokyo,#believing in science is seen as#strange."
7="Hold on. Didn't I see her#before? I'm guessing her#colorful appearance is making my#eyes saturated."
8="She talks funny."
9="All of her attacks were kind of#suspicious."

[1]
0="That was a piece of cake. Is she#always like that or is she just#weak? C'mon, she should be#training more."
1="Ufufufufu. Did I get fury?"
2="Looks like I beat my mother,#ufufufufu."
3="Looks like she uses magic as#well - an incomphrensible kind!"
4="A princess? The people in this#land say I should be one too.#Even my parents prophesized that#from my birth!"
5="I can't even see her face. What#kind of humanoid is she?"
6="She seems to have some pretty#powerful magic, so why is she#dressed like that?"
7="She must be an entertainer like#I am. Why does she even say#she's royal?"
8="What was that?"
9="That was pretty interesting.#See ya!"

[2]
0="She's so weak, as always! I#can't believe she's a shrine#maiden! Hehehe!"
1="Train harder, Marisa."
2="Heh, who are you?"
3="I see she's not humanoid either."
4="She's a rather strange kind of#humanoid!"
5="Where did she come from?"
6="That was quite a good one!"
7="Just why did I defeat a youkai-#born? I feel ashamed of myself!"
8="What was that clumsy attack?"
9="That was by no means an#unavoidable attack."

[3]
0="Shinsenjutsu? How is that#different from magic?"
1="Oof! She reeks in magic and uses#famous spells too!"
2="Oh my God, she doesn't look like#she belongs in this world!"
3="Ah, there's another me! I wonder#if she can help with my work."
4="She's a weirdo."
5="Oh, glad to meet her, even#though I've already fought her."
6="Does her clothes make her a#'nice nurse?' Is there even#anyone who understands what this#means?"
7="Where did she come from? Does#she jump through time?"
8="Her clothes are strange."
9="Is she a Crimsonite?"

[4]
0="Oh my God, that's what an#unknown creature is, y'know."
1="I'm a little better, though. Did#the people say she should become#a princess like me?"
2="Ah, her danmaku is beautiful.#Simply amazing."
3="A magic shop? I'm running a bit#short, so maybe I should ask her#for something."
4="Oh God, it's me."
5="Oh, a bird keeper?"
6="Hey, there's a ghost behind you."
7="Princess vs. princess? Only the#strongest of royalty can win!"
8="The sailor Liebe..."
9="Nothing to be scared of."

[5]
0="A shrine maiden? How old-#fashioned!"
1="An oriental sorcerer? What a#wierdo."
2="She definitely doesn't have#legs."
3="Woah! A real witch!?"
4="Looks like there's nothing but#weird people around here."
5="Have I become strange as well?#Fighting myself and all!"
6="She's wearing weird clothes too."
7="What's with her hairstyle? Did#she get that extra fancy there?"
8="That was an unexpectedly close#fight."
9="They say I say: a fake magician?"

[6]
0="She means that's it? I thought#she was a shrine maiden."
1="Even though she's wearing those#clothes, is her magic only that#powerful?"
2="Her existence is affected by#magic as well, I see."
3="Where did she come from?"
4="Be a good girl and go home."
5="She did well."
6="Are we both the real thing?"
7="She comes far from the future.#What kind of magic is found#there?"
8="It's fake magic after all!"
9="Why does she hold such an#interest in magic when she#already possesses such a#magnificent power?"

[7]
0="This is the moment where a#youkai-born beats a shrine#maiden, or perhaps Kumiko's#ancestor."
1="I just defeated a younger#version of Queen Marisa. Is this#what she obviously looked like?"
2="Queen Marisa's mother may only#be a ghost, but I certainly#can't take any royalty from her!"
3="She could serve her sweet magic#to me, but only if I'm a maid!"
4="My beauty is more danmaku than#royalty. She also dresses a lot#like me when it's formal!"
5="I would one day want to see her#at a maid caf√©, including#myself."
6="Hold on, how is this possible in#the Edo period? We didn't have#lab coats back then..."
7="Did I just beat myself? Or#perhaps it was an impostor among#us?"
8="Go back to school, kiddo."
9="Rumors say this is where many#Crimsonites descended from."

[8]
0="Looks like she needs more#training."
1="Ha, she was as weak as I#thought."
2="Haha, she really needs to review#the basics."
3="Man, I want magic, too."
4="It's not just about how much#danmaku she's got."
5="I wonder if I could get an#outfit like that for myself."
6="Why is she in a doctor's robe?"
7="Where did she come from?#Certainly not here though!"
8="Looks like I'm pretty strong in#the magical world!"
9="You're pretty strong, even if#you don't have magic."

[9]
0="Oh, a real shrine maiden? How#wonderful."
1="Oh, a real magician? How#wonderful!"
2="Oh, an evil spirit? Wonderful!"
3="Oh, a real witch? How wonderful."
4="Ah, unknown people are wonderful#too."
5="Oh, everything is so wonderful#here."
6="Oh, you can use magic, but#what's that outfit for?"
7="Oh, a youkai-born, from the#future!?"
8="Do your job, Chiyuri, like#cleaning or something!"
9="That should prevent any energy#imbalances."
