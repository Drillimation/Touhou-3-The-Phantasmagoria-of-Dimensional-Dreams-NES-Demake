0="I just noticed I'm the only one#left. That means I beat them#all."
1="Anyway, I guess I'm allowed to#enter the ruins now. These#ancients had an amazing culture."
2="Don't move!"
3="Eek! What, what?"
4="So, you're the strongest#magician? Come with me#immediately."
5="What are you talking about?"
6="This may look small, but it's a#lethal weapon. If you value your#life, you'll do as I say."
7="Are you an ancient?"
8="Of course not! The ancients'#culture was nothing more than#that of monkeys. And I can't#believe you still think these#are ruins."
9="So, they aren't ruins?"
10="Never mind, just come with me."
11="W-wait!"
12="*whack*"
13="Who told you to grant such poor#hospitality!?"
14="But it's more fun this way!"
15="*whack*"
16="You're scaring the guest we've#been waiting for!"
17="Uh, what?"
18="Ah, please forgive our odd#reception."
19="Who are you, second ancient- I#mean... Ms. Alien?"
20="Who are you calling an alien?#Aliens are slippery and slimy,#like octopi or squids. Don't#group us with them."
21="Again, I'm this ship's captain,#Yumemi Okazaki. It's a pleasure#to meet you."
22="I'm her crew member, Chiyuri#Kitashirakawa. Nice to meet you."
23="Wait a moment. Did you just say#ship? Is this some sort of ship?"
24="That's right. Well, we call it a#ship, but it doesn't float along#the water, or glide through the#clouds, or drift through space,#or anything like that."
25="This ship is called a#probability space hypervessel.#I've come here on this ship in#search of something that doesn't#fit into the grand theory."
26="There's magic all over the#place. For a comparative#physicist, I'm far too lucky."
27="Anyway, I don't really#understand, but you just popped#out from somewhere, like maggots#or something."
28="Why do we just have to pop out#of somewhere? And don't compare#us to maggots, please! We came#from another world."
29="We call that other world a#Probability World. It's a#different world, but it's in the#same dimension."
30="Are you talking about parallel#worlds?"
31="Is that what you call them here?#They must be the same thing."
32="So, what did you come here for?"
33="I said this before, but I came#in search of magic."
34="Can't you find that anywhere#you go?"
35="Not in our world! That's why I#need to examine your power."
36="How?"
37="We just have to fight. I'll just#observe you while you're doing#it. Will you help me?"
38="For free?"
39="Uh, of course not! That is,#well... If you're a particularly#strong magic user, I'll grant#you whatever you wish, provided#it is within my power."
40="But if it's weak, we don't need#it."
41="That's fine. You can't use#magic, can you? If you can't use#magic, this will be easy!"
42="Well then, do your best,#Chiyuri. I'll be monitoring#this world of magic in the#meantime."
43="By that, you mean..."
44="I mean I want you to fight her!"
45="Man, I was afraid of that..."
46="*whack*"
47="Quit whining and defeat her this#instant! You have my scientific#magic, don't you?"
48="You'll probably lose anyway,#but if you lose right away we#won't be able to understand#anything. In that time, I'll#gather data!"
49="No way out of this, huh? Let's#fight!"
50="You think you can win?"
