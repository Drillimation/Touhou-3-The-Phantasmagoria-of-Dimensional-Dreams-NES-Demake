0="Chiyuri, you lost too quickly!"
1="But..."
2="No 'buts'! And no rear ends#either! I couldn't get nearly#enough data!"
3="Geez, if you had won, we could#have just put her under and#taken her home!"
4="What!?"
5="That's right. I've finally found#the beautiful power called magic#in this world. I won't settle#for just observations anymore."
6="I'm going to take you back as a#test specimen, study that power,#and then make it mine!"
7="Oh my, such a troublesome#person! Weren't you gonna grant#me a wish?"
8="That's fine. I'll grant you a#wish, according to the pamphlet.#But only if you beat me."
9="If I win, you'll come back to#our world. That should suffice,#even though it's not like I'm#giving you a choice."
10="So it's you this time? Okay,#let's go then."
11="Hold on just a moment. I need to#change into my battle wear."
12="Oh dear."
13="Okay, I'm ready."
14="All you did was put on a cape."
15="*slap*"
16="Give it your all! If you die, I#can't take you back with me#after all."
17="Oh, one last thing."
18="What?"
19="What's 'science'?"
20="It's a method of justifying the#laziness of mankind."
21="That can't be right! That's what#sense, logic, and laws are#called."
22="..."
