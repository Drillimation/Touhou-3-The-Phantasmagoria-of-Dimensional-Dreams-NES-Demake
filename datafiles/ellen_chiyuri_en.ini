0="Finally, I can go in the ruins!#I wonder why all the people#around were so strong?"
1="Oh dear, what is this? There's a#lot of weird stuff in here!"
2="Don't move!"
3="Eek! Who's there!?"
4="So, you're the strongest#magician, are you? Come with#me immediately."
5="But why?"
6="This may look small, but it's a#lethal weapon. If you value your#life, you'll do as I say."
7="What's that? Could it be#dangerous? Hee-ya!"
8="Gah! Quit it! What the heck did#you do that for? Well, anyway,#come with me."
9="Hey, wait a second!"
10="*whack*"
11="Who told you to grant such poor#hospitality!?"
12="But it's more fun this way!"
13="*whack*"
14="You're scaring the guest we've#been waiting for!"
15="Ahahaha!"
16="Ah, please forgive our odd#reception."
17="Oh dear. Since you apologized, I#guess I have to forgive you."
18="I am the captain of this ship,#Yumemi Okazaki. It's a pleasure#to meet you."
19="And I'm her crew member, Chiyuri#Kitashirakawa. Nice to meet you."
20="I'm Ellen, Fluffy Ellen."
21="Anyway, you had a reason to come#here today certainly?"
22="You're gonna give me something,#right?"
23="I'm sorry?"
24="Well, you wrote those pamphlets,#didn't you?"
25="Oh, I wrote those."
26="A pamphlet? Here, let me see."
27="'The Ancient Ruins'#Fantasy Ruins#Opens at 10:00 AM today."
28="Those who visit these ruins will#be given a present to grant them#happiness. We eagerly await your#patronization."
29="What is this? You've come all#this way just after seeing this#pamphlet, huh."
30="Ahahahaha!"
31="First, you have to help me with#my research. I've been using#this probability space hyper-#vessel to search for magic."
32="In other words, I want you to#show me your powers to prove the#existence of magic. Second, your#magic must be truly powerful."
33="If you fulfill these two#conditions, then I'll grant you#what you desire, provided it is#within my ability to do so?"
34="You'll make my wish come true?#Yay!"
35="So that's an okay then."
36="Basically, you want to test my#power, right?"
37="Indeed, a battle is fine. That#way, I can investigate your#magic too."
38="Well then, do your best,#Chiyuri. I'll be monitoring this#world of magic in the meantime."
39="By that, you mean..."
40="I mean I want you to fight her!"
41="Man, I was afraid of that..."
42="*whack*"
43="Quit whining and defeat her this#instant! You have my scientific#magic, don't you?"
44="You'll probably lose anyway,#but if you lose right away we#won't be able to understand#anything. In that time, I'll#gather data!"
45="No way out of this, huh? Let's#fight!"
46="Go go!"
