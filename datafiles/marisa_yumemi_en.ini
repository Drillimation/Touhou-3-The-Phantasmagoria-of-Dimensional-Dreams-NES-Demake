0="Chiyuri, you lost too quickly!"
1="But..."
2="No 'buts'! And no rear ends#either! I couldn't get nearly#enough data!"
3="Geez, if you had won, we could#have just put her under and#taken her home!"
4="What!?"
5="That's right. I've finally found#the beautiful power called magic#in this world. I won't settle#for just observations anymore."
6="I'm going to take you back as a#test specimen, study that power,#and then make it mine!"
7="Uh, that's pretty greedy, I#think."
8="My scientific magic is, after#all, merely an imitation of#magic. It can't prevail against#the real thing."
9="It doesn't use magic - it is a#thing born of only positively-#charged photons and light waves."
10="With that, I'll defeat you with#the power of my science, and#then bring you back to my world."
11="I'm not just some 'thing', you know."
12="If you can manage to defeat me#in battle, I'll give you what#you wish, according to the#pamphlet."
13="If I win, you'll come back to#our world. That should suffice,#even though it's not like I'm#giving you a choice."
14="There's a chance, at least..."
15="Are you sure about that?"
16="Well, let's fight and find out#then!"
17="Hold on just a moment. I need to#change into my battle wear."
18="Hurry up..."
19="Okay, I'm ready."
20="All you did was put on a cape."
21="*slap*"
22="Give it your all! If you die, I#can't take you back with me#after all."
23="Same to you."
24="Okay, here I come!"
25="Ahaha!"
