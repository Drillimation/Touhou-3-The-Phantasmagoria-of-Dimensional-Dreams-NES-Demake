0="As I thought, I'm number one.#Well, that was the obvious#result. Leaving that aside, it's#about time for the ruins to open#shop."
1="What are these ruins? I've never#seen any of this before."
2="Don't move!"
3="What!?"
4="So, you're the strongest#magician? Come with me#immediately."
5="Ha, aren't you a defiant#challenger? You wanna fight?"
6="Heh, I don't plan on fighting#you. Just come with me."
7="What if I say no?"
8="This may look small, but it's a#lethal weapon. If you value your#life, you'll do as I say."
9="No."
10="..."
11="Well, I guess that's that."
12="Hey, hey!"
13="What is it? I'm busy. I don't#have time to bother with you."
14="A-anyway, just come with me."
15="Hey, wai-"
16="*whack*"
17="Who told you to grant such poor#hospitality!?"
18="But it's more fun this way!"
19="*whack*"
20="You're scaring the guest we've#been waiting for!"
21="I'm not really scared at all."
22="Ah, please forgive our odd#reception."
23="Anyway, who are you people?"
24="I am the captain of this ship,#Yumemi Okazaki. It's a pleasure#to meet you."
25="And I'm her crew member, Chiyuri#Kitashirakawa. Nice to meet you."
26="Wait, hold on. Did you just say#a 'ship'? Is this all a ship?"
27="That's right. Well, we call it a#ship, but it doesn't float along#the water, or glide through the#clouds, or drift through space,#or anything like that."
28="This ship is called a#probability space hypervessel.#I've come here on this ship in#search of something that doesn't#fit into the grand theory."
29="That said, I found it quite#quickly! Ah, seeing magic with#your own eyes is something else!"
30="Perhaps I should mention that#I'm not humanoid."
31="What!? Then are you an animal?#Or maybe an alien, walking#plant, a Punyumkin, Tukupuku,#Hegeromuchamucha, or something?"
32="Annoyed is what I am! Anyway,#this body is really just, a#soul."
33="So that means you're a wandering#dead spirit?"
34="Do I look like a dead spirit?"
35="An evil spirit?"
36="I'm going home!"
37="Wait, I'm sorry! I would like to#study your power and magic in-#depth, and then take my revenge#on the academy!"
38="The academy?"
39="The captain subscribes to a#theory that magic exists apart#from the Grand Unified Theory."
40="She announced her Non-Unified#Magic World Theory to the#Academy. When she did that, she#was laughted out of the place."
41="Hehe, is that so?"
42="In any case, if your magic is#truly powerful, you'll complete#my research. You'll help me,#won't you?"
43="No."
44="Heh, I won't let you say no, as#you can't leave here anymore."
45="What do you want me to do then!?"
46="I just want you to let me study#your power. In other words, I#want you to fight."
47="Oho, if you want a fight, then#I'm all for it."
48="You're okay with it then. Good#luck, Chiyuri. I'll be#monitoring this world of magic#in the meantime."
49="By that, you mean..."
50="I mean I want you to fight her!"
51="Man, I was afraid of that..."
52="*whack*"
53="Quit whining and defeat her this#instant! You have my scientific#magic, don't you?"
54="You'll probably lose anyway,#but if you lose right away we#won't be able to understand#anything. In that time, I'll#gather data!"
55="No way out of this, huh? Let's#fight!"
56="Show me your best!"
