0="Chiyuri, you lost too quickly!"
1="But..."
2="No 'buts'! And no rear ends#either! I couldn't get nearly#enough data!"
3="Geez, if you had won, we could#have just put her under and#taken her home!"
4="What was that!?"
5="That's right. I've finally found#the beautiful power called magic#in this world. I won't settle#for just observations anymore."
6="I'm going to take you back as a#test specimen, study that power,#and then make it mine!"
7="I knew I smelled something#fishy. However, your artificial#magic isn't anything special.#How exactly do you plan on#bringing me back?"
8="My scientific magic is, after#all, merely an imitation of#magic. It can't prevail against#the real thing."
9="It doesn't use magic - it is a#thing born of only positively-#charged photons and light waves."
10="However, I saw through your#attacks while you were fighting#Chiyuri. I have an advantageous#position."
11="So, you gonna use brute force?"
12="If you can manage to defeat me#in battle, I'll give you what#you wish, according to the#pamphlet."
13="If I win, you'll come back to#our world. That should suffice,#even though it's not like I'm#giving you a choice."
14="No matter what, I won't lose!#Here we go!"
15="Hold on just a moment. I need to#change into my battle wear."
16="What's that?"
17="Okay, I'm ready."
18="All you did was put on a cape."
19="*slap*"
20="Give it your all! If you die, I#can't take you back with me#after all."
21="I got it!"
22="Okay, here I come!"
23="Don't underestimate me."
