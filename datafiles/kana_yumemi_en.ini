0="Chiyuri, you lost too quickly!"
1="But..."
2="No 'buts'! And no rear ends#either! I couldn't get nearly#enough data!"
3="Geez, if you had won, we could#have just put her under and#taken her home!"
4="What was that!?"
5="That's right. I've finally found#the beautiful power called magic#in this world. I won't settle#for just observations anymore."
6="I'm going to take you back as a#test specimen, study that power,#and then make it mine!"
7="I thought so. The thought of#granting a wish was too good to#be true. If that's the way you#feel, I have no choice but to#resist."
8="I see. I'll have to use all of#my power in order to fight you."
9="If you can manage to defeat me#in battle, I'll give you what#you wish, according to the#pamphlet."
10="If I win, you'll come back to#our world. That should suffice,#even though it's not like I'm#giving you a choice."
11="You'll grant my wish? Suddenly,#my will to fight is returning!"
12="Hold on just a moment. I need to#change into my battle wear."
13="Hurry up."
14="Okay, I'm ready."
15="All you did was put on a cape."
16="*slap*"
17="Give it your all! If you die, I#can't take you back with me#after all."
18="Same to you!"
19="Okay, here I come!"
20="Let's do this already!"
