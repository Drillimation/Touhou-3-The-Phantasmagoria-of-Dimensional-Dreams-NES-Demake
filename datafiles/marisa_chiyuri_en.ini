0="Ufufufufu, I beat them all! Oh#yeah, I've finally reached the#ruins. So, what do I get? Is#this really a ruin?"
1="Don't move!"
2="Eyah, w-w-what!?"
3="So, you're the strongest magic#user, are you? Come with me#immediately."
4="Say what!?"
5="This may look small, but it's a#lethal weapon. If you value your#life, you'll do as I say."
6="This doesn't look like a ruin.#It's more like a crazy mansion."
7="Uh, not quite. Anyway, come with#me."
8="Now, wai-"
9="*whack*"
10="Who told you to grand such poor#hospitality!?"
11="But it's more fun this way!"
12="*whack*"
13="You're scaring the guest we've#been waiting for!"
14="What's going on?"
15="Ah, please forgive our odd#reception."
16="Who are you?"
17="I am the captain of this ship,#Yumemi Okazaki. It's a pleasure#to meet you."
18="And I'm her crew member, Chiyuri#Kitashirakawa. Nice to meet you."
19="Ship? This is a ship?"
20="That's right. Well, we call it a#ship, but it doesn't float along#the water, or glide through the#clouds, or drift through space,#or anything like that."
21="This ship is called a#probability space hypervessel.#I've come here on this ship in#search of something that doesn't#fit into the grand theory."
22="..."
23="So, it's not some crazy mansion,#but a crazy broken-down old#ship."
24="That said, I found it quite#quickly! Ah, seeing magic with#your own eyes is something else!"
25="You've never seen magic before?"
26="In our world, all power can be#explained by using the Grand#Unified Theory I mentioned."
27="However, I published a paper#called 'The Non-Unified Magic#World', in which I posited the#existence of a power not covered#by the theory of magic."
28="The people at the Science#Academy laughed me out of#practice for believing in such#things."
29="But now, I've found it. This#power is yours. All I want to do#is study your power."
30="Once I know its secret, I'll#have my revenge on the Science#Academy!"
31="Wait, I don't get it. You're#gonna give me something, right?"
32="Give you what?"
33="Didn't you write this pamphlet!?"
34="Oh, I wrote those."
35="A pamphlet? Here, let me see."
36="'The Ancient Ruins'#Fantasy Ruins#Opens at 10:00 AM today."
37="Those who visit these ruins will#be given a present to grant them#happiness. We eagerly await your#patronization."
38="What is this? You've come all#this way just after seeing this#pamphlet, huh."
39="Haha! But you're gonna give me#something, right?"
40="Well, I don't have much of a#choice, seeing as how it's#written here."
41="If your magic is truly powerful,#I'll grant you what you desire,#provided it is within my ability#to do so."
42="But if it's weak, we don't need#it."
43="That should be acceptable, is it#not?"
44="Okay, so you want to test me#then!"
45="Well then, do your best,#Chiyuri. I'll be monitoring this#world of magic in the meantime."
46="By that, you mean..."
47="I mean I want you to fight her!"
48="Man, I was afraid of that..."
49="*whack*"
50="Quit whining and defeat her this#instant! You have my scientific#magic, don't you?"
51="You'll probably lose anyway,#but if you lose right away we#won't be able to understand#anything. In that time, I'll#gather data!"
52="No way out of this, huh? Let's#fight!"
53="I wonder what I should wish for!"
