0="This world is so nice. It's#absolutely full of magic. Well,#time for a break."
1="Chiyuri, I'm back! Are you#there?"
2="Don't move!"
3="What's this!?"
4="Who are you?"
5="Stop fooling around, Chiyuri."
6="Master? Wait, but..."
7="*whack*"
8="Don't point that thing at other#people! It's dangerous!"
9="B-but..."
10="What's with all this racket!?"
11="Oh, master..."
12="Uh, what?"
13="What!? What is this!?"
14="Chiyuri, I hope you weren't#playing with my machines!"
15="I'm sorry! I may have touched#one or two..."
16="So then you did! You could've#sent the ship completely off-#course! What are we going to do#with another me?"
17="Eek! B-but, if there's two of#you, then you can get twice as#much research done!"
18="No, it's causing an energy#imbalance! If we went back like#this, we'd be criminals!"
19="Uh, so, which one of you is the#real professor?"
20="Both of us!"
21="In any case, Chiyuri deserves a#punishment for having gotten us#into this mess!"
22="Eek!"
