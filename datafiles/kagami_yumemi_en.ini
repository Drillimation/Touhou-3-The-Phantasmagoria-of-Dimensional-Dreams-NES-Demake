2="No 'buts'! She was moving way#too fast! If you had won, we#could've kept her as slave!"
3="Wait, what!?"
4="I think I found the most#powerful youkai-born in the#land! Your power will be mine#once you're sealed."
5="You still going to grant me that#wish? How are you going to#defeat the most powerful youkai-#born here?"
6="I'll try my strongest scientific#magic on you. Although it's an#imitation, it won't go against#the real thing like in your time#period."
7="The science class taught by the#Scarlet Devil can prove you're#not welcome!"
8="Scarlet Devil!? How many#Crimsonite descendants did you#produce in the years that#passed?"
9="No need to talk about my family.#I will still grant you that wish#if you win. Should I win, you#will be a special guest of our#world."
10="Roll out the rug, sensei."
11="Just let me put on my cape."
12="Go on."
13="Give me all your will. Once your#death occurs, I will take back#your soul."
14="This is going to be a long and#fun night."
