0="Just as I thought, I'm the#strongest. Yep, I can now#finally enter the ruins. I#wonder what's in here."
1="But what is all this? Just look#at all this weird stuff. Are#these really ruins?"
2="Don't move!"
3="Eh? Wh-what's going on?"
4="So, you're the strongest#magician, right? Come with me#immediately."
5="What the heck are you talking#about?"
6="This may look small, but it's a#lethal weapon. If you value your#life, you'll do as I say."
7="What are these ruins supposed to#be? Are you an ancient, or a#mummy or something?"
8="Of course not! And I can't#believe you still think these#are ruins."
9="I, uh..."
10="Anyway, come with me."
11="Hey, wai-"
12="*whack*"
13="Who told you to grant such poor#hospitality!?"
14="But it's more fun this way!"
15="*whack*"
16="You're scaring the guest we've#been waiting for!"
17="Um, er..."
18="Ah, please forgive our odd#reception."
19="Whatever. Just who are you two,#exactly?"
20="I am the captain of this ship,#Yumemi Okazaki. It's a pleasure#to meet you."
21="And I'm her crew member, Chiyuri#Kitashirakawa. Nice to meet you."
22="Hold on, did you say this is a#'ship'? Is all this a ship?"
23="That's right. Well, we call it a#ship, but it doesn't float along#the water, or glide through the#clouds, or drift through space,#or anything like that."
24="This ship is called a#probability space hypervessel.#I've come here on this ship in#search of something that doesn't#fit into the grand theory."
25="That said, I found it quite#quickly! Ah, seeing magic with#your own eyes is something else!"
26="It's not magic."
27="Ah, seeing magic with your own#eyes is something else!"
28="It's divine power, not magic!"
29="It's ma-gic, right?"
30="It doesn't really matter which.#I don't get any of this, but#you're gonna give me something,#right?"
31="What do you mean?"
32="The pamphlet says so!"
33="Oh, I wrote those."
34="A pamphlet? Here, let me see."
35="'The Ancient Ruins'#Fantasy Ruins#Opens at 10:00 AM today."
36="Those who visit these ruins will#be given a present to grant them#happiness. We eagerly await your#patronization."
37="What is this? You've come all#this way just after seeing this#pamphlet, huh."
38="Haha! But you're gonna give me#something, right?"
39="Well, I don't have much of a#choice, seeing as how it's#written here. I would like to#study your power and magic in-#depth, and then take my revenge!"
40="The captain subscribes to a#theory that magic exists apart#from the Grand Unified Theory."
41="She announced her Non-Unified#Magic World Theory to the#academy."
42="When she did that, she was#laughed out of the place."
43="In any case, if your magic is#truly powerful, I'll grant you#what you desire, provided it is#within my ability to do so."
44="But if it's weak, we don't need#it."
45="That should be acceptable, is it#not?"
46="Well, if you grant me a wish,#then it's okay with me!"
47="Well then, do your best,#Chiyuri. I'll be monitoring this#world of magic in the meantime."
48="By that, you mean..."
49="I mean I want you to fight her!"
50="Man, I was afraid of that..."
51="*whack*"
52="Quit whining and defeat her this#instant! You have my scientific#magic, don't you?"
53="You'll probably lose anyway,#but if you lose right away we#won't be able to understand#anything. In that time, I'll#gather data!"
54="No way out of this, huh? Let's#fight!"
55="It's not magic, it's divine#power, but..."
