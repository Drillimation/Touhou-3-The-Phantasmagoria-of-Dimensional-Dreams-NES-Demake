0="The power seeping from these#ruins is definitely not magic.#This could be what I've been#looking for."
1="I defeated all of my opponents,#so I should be able to get in#now. What is this anyway?"
2="Don't move!"
3="Huh, what?"
4="So, you're the strongest#magician? Come with me#immediately."
5="Who's there!? Well, I am the one#intruding."
6="This may look small, but it's a#lethal weapon. If you value your#life, you'll do as I say."
7="Snotty and belligerent. But what#is that weapon?"
8="?"
9="Is that the thing that turns#even monkeys into that when it#hits?"
10="What's that? This is a weapon#from another world."
11="!?"
12="Anyway, come with me."
13="W-wait a second!"
14="*whack*"
15="Who told you to grant such poor#hospitality!?"
16="But it's more fun this way!"
17="*whack*"
18="You're scaring the guest we've#been waiting for!"
19="Oh."
20="Ah, please forgive our odd#reception."
21="Uh, no, I... More importantly,#where are we, exactly? These#don't look like historic ruins."
22="Let's not get ahead of#ourselves. I'm Yumemi Okazaki, a#comparative physics professor."
23="I'm Chiyuri. Chiyuri#Kitashirakawa. I'm Lady Yumemi's#assistant."
24="Ah, pardon me. I'm Risako#Asakura."
25="In regard to your previous#question, this is a probability#space hypervessel."
26="I've come here on this ship in#search of something that doesn't#fit into the grand unified#theory."
27="There are too many words I don't#understand. You said earlier#that you're from a different#world."
28="That's right. You're pretty#sharp."
29="May I ask you something? What is#the source of power here?"
30="It's nuclear fusion energy, but#what about it?"
31="So it isn't magic powered?"
32="Ah, I see. This power doesn't#exist in our world. In this#world, magic unifies everything."
33="Worlds like that, as well as#worlds that are the opposite and#those with a mixture of the two,#exist. At least that was my#theory."
34="But I was right after all. To#think that magic actually exists#here..."
35="I see. That's very fascinating.#So why have you invited people#out here?"
36="That's because I want to use#them to research magic, of#course. Would you like to assist#me?"
37="What's in it for me?"
38="Uh, well, if you're a#particularly strong magic user,#I'll grant you any wish,#provided it's within my power."
39="But if it's weak, we don't need#it."
40="I look forward to it. So, what#should we do then?"
41="We just have to fight. I'll just#observe you while you're doing#it. How about it? Will you help#me?"
42="That's fine. I just have to#fight you, right? I'd very much#like to see some non-magical#power."
43="Well then, do your best,#Chiyuri. I'll be monitoring#this world of magic in the#meantime."
44="By that, you mean..."
45="I mean I want you to fight her!"
46="Man, I was afraid of that..."
47="*whack*"
48="Quit whining and defeat her this#instant! You have my scientific#magic, don't you?"
49="You'll probably lose anyway,#but if you lose right away we#won't be able to understand#anything. In that time, I'll#gather data!"
50="No way out of this, huh? Let's#fight!"
51="Hehehehe..."
