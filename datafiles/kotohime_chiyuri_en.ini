0="I was the strongest. So let's go#into the ruins! I hope there's#something inside."
1="Oh, these are amazing ruins.#What a discovery! The ancients#used electricity!"
2="Don't move!"
3="I'm not moving!"
4="So you're the strongest#magician, are you? Come with me#immediately."
5="Aren't you too far away to#threaten me?"
6="This may look small, but it's a#lethal weapon. If you value your#life, you'll do as I say."
7="Okay, I will."
8="Wait, at least show a little#resistance!"
9="Why?"
10="Uh, nevermind, just come with#me."
11="Okay!"
12="*whack*"
13="Who told you to grant such poor#hospitality!?"
14="But it's more fun this way!"
15="*whack*"
16="You're scaring the guest we've#been waiting for! She wan't even#resisting."
17="Excuse me..."
18="Ah, please forgive our odd#reception."
19="Who are you people?"
20="I am the captain of this ship,#Yumemi Okazaki. It's a pleasure#to meet you."
21="And I'm her crew member, Chiyuri#Kitashirakawa. Nice to meet you."
22="Ship?"
23="That's right. Well, we call it a#ship, but it doesn't float along#the water, or glide through the#clouds, or drift through space,#or anything like that."
24="I see. So this is the ruins of a#ship then?"
25="Ah, I'm so happy! Seeing magic#with your own eyes is something#else! For a comparative#physicist, I'm far too lucky."
26="I see. So you're out of luck#now?"
27="Anyway, now I can show this to#the scientific society."
28="I see. So you're a heretic of#science then."
29="Hey, watch it there. Do you#really have strong magical#powers? If you're not strong,#you can't be part of my study."
30="I'm not sure."
31="Hey now, you wouldn't have made#it in here if you weren't#strong, right?"
32="I guess you could say that."
33="What the heck? Anyway, I'd like#to study your powers. I would#like to learn as much as I can#about magic."
34="The captain subscribes to a#theory that magic exists apart#from the Grand Unified Theory."
35="She announced her Non-Unified#Magic World Theory to the#Academy. When she did that, she#was laughted out of the place."
36="In any case, if your magic is#truly powerful, I'll grant you#anything you wish, provided it#is within my power."
37="But if it's weak, we don't need#it."
38="That should be acceptable, eh?"
39="I might be weak."
40="This is acceptable, right? Well#then, do your best, Chiyuri.#I'll be monitoring this world of#magic in the meantime."
41="By that, you mean..."
42="I mean I want you to fight her!"
43="Man, I was afraid of that..."
44="*whack*"
45="Quit whining and defeat her this#instant! You have my scientific#magic, don't you?"
46="You'll probably lose anyway,#but if you lose right away we#won't be able to understand#anything. In that time, I'll#gather data!"
47="No way out of this, huh? Let's#fight!"
48="I'm really strong, though..."
