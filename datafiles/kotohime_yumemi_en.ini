0="Chiyuri, you lost too quickly!"
1="But..."
2="No 'buts'! And no rear ends#either! I couldn't get nearly#enough data!"
3="Geez, if you had won, we could#have just put her under and#taken her home!"
4="Oh?"
5="That's right. I've finally found#the beautiful power called magic#in this world. I won't settle#for just observations anymore."
6="I'm going to take you back as a#test specimen, study that power,#and then make it mine!"
7="Hmm, so what are you going to#do?"
8="I'm going to beat you and carry#you home."
9="That'll never work."
10="How dare you ridicule me! I'm#strong than Chiyuri! I'll fight#you and if you manage to win,#I'll grant you a wish."
11="If I win, you'll come back to#our world. That should suffice,#even though it's not like I'm#giving you a choice."
12="That's the spirit! Let's do#this!"
13="Hold on just a moment. I need to#change into my battle wear."
14="I'll wait."
15="Okay, I'm ready."
16="All you did was put on a cape."
17="*slap*"
18="Give it your all! If you die, I#can't take you back with me#after all."
19="Put some spirit in it! I can't#get my wish if you die!"
20="Okay, here I come!"
21="But you look weak."
