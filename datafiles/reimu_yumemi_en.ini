0="Chiyuri, you lost too quickly!"
1="But..."
2="No 'buts'! And no rear ends#either! I couldn't get nearly#enough data!"
3="Geez, if you had won, we could#have just put her under and#taken her home!"
4="What!?"
5="That's right. I've finally found#the beautiful power called magic#in this world. I won't settle#for just observations anymore."
6="I'm going to take you back as a#test specimen, study that power,#and then make it mine!"
7="I had a hunch that 'granting a#wish was an exaggeration."
8="But I've already beaten that#'scentific magic' you created. I#wonder how you're going to beat#me."
9="My scientific magic is, after#all, merely an imitation of#magic. It can't prevail against#the real thing."
10="It doesn't use magic - it is a#thing born of only positively-#charged photons and light waves."
11="I don't have magic, but I have#the power of science. Because of#that, I am well-versed in hidden#things."
12="What do hidden things have to do#with it exactly?"
13="Nothing."
14="Well, okay. If you can manage to#defeat me in battle, I'll give#you what you wish, according to#the pamphlet."
15="If I win, you'll come back to#our world. That should suffice,#even though it's not like I'm#giving you a choice."
16="I won't lose anyway. Let's go!"
17="Hold on just a moment. I need to#change into my battle wear."
18="Not nervous at all, I see."
19="Okay, I'm ready."
20="All you did was put on a cape."
21="*slap*"
22="Give it your all! If you die, I#can't take you back with me#after all."
23="Same to you!"
24="Okay, here I come!"
25="Though it's not magic, it's#divine power."
